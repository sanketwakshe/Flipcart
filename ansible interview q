what is used ansible ?
= Ansible is primarily used as an open-source IT automation tool for simplifying and managing repetitive tasks, configurations, deployments, and orchestrations across infrastructure and applications. It provides an efficient and scalable way to automate processes in diverse environments, including on-premises servers, cloud platforms, containers, and networking devices.
1] what is ment by configuration managment ?
= Configuration Management is a systematic process for managing, organizing, and maintaining the consistency of a system's functional and physical attributes over its lifecycle. It ensures that system resources (hardware, software, and other components) are in a known, desired state and remain that way even after changes or updates are made.
2]  Do you think ansible is better than other configuration management tools if yes why ?
= Yes, Ansible is considered better than many other configuration management tools in certain scenarios due to its simplicity, ease of use, and flexibility. However, the "best" tool depends on specific use cases and requirements. Here's why Ansible often stands out:
* Agentless Architecture:
Ansible does not require agents to be installed on managed nodes. It uses SSH for communication, which simplifies deployment and reduces overhead compared to tools like Puppet or Chef that rely on agents.
* Ease of Use:
Configuration is defined in human-readable YAML files called playbooks, making it intuitive for beginners and non-programmers.
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
Ansible playbooks allow for declarative infrastructure definition, making them excellent for DevOps practices and Continuous Integration
3] can you write an ansible playbook to install httpd service and get it running ?
= ---
- name: Install and Start HTTPD Service
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install HTTPD package
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Ensure HTTPD service is started and enabled
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true

    - name: Verify HTTPD service is running
      command: systemctl is-active httpd
      register: httpd_status
      changed_when: false

    - name: Debug HTTPD status
      debug:
        msg: "HTTPD service is {{ httpd_status.stdout }}"
4] How ansible helped you organization ?
= Ansible is a powerful tool for IT automation and configuration management, and it has helped organizations in various ways. Here's how it can benefit an organization
* Simplified IT Automation
Before Ansible: Manual or semi-automated processes for deploying applications, managing configurations, or provisioning infrastructure were error-prone and time-consuming.
*Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Before Ansible: Configurations were managed manually or through disparate scripts.

5] can you explain me structure of ansible playbook using roles ?
= ---
- name: Deploy Web Application
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: webserver
      vars:
        httpd_port: 8080

- name: Setup Database
  hosts: dbservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - role: dbserver
