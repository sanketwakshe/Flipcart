1] what is the docker ?
= Docker is the open source containerization. Docker is a tool that allows you to package and run applications in isolated environments called containers.
  It simplifies the process of deploying, managing, and scaling applications by making them portable and consistent across different systems

2] What is the container ?
= A container is a lightweight, portable, and isolated environment where an application runs.
It includes everything the application needs, such as code, libraries, and dependencies, so the application can run consistently on any system or environment. 
Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host operating system's kernel, making them faster and more efficient.
Containers ensure that the application works the same way, no matter where it's run â€“ whether on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud.

3] what is docker cli ?
= The Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool used to interact with Docker from the command line. It allows users to manage Docker containers, images, networks, and volumes, as well as to execute commands on Docker hosts.
ex run, stop, build

4] Diff betwn Virtual machine and Docker container 
container                                                      |    Virtual machine
Shares the host OS kernel.                                     |  Runs a full OS (guest OS) on top of the host OS.
Faster, uses fewer resources.                                  | Slower, more resource-intensive.
Isolation	Isolated but shares the host OS.	                    | Full isolation with a separate OS for each VM.          [contianer light weight ahe fact je hav tech ghrnar purn os ghenar nahi ani fast ahe ,,, virtual machine purn os install karte ani jara slow ahe ]
Portability	Highly portable, can run anywhere with Docker      | Less portable, depends on specific hardware or hypervisor.
support.	
Use Case	Best for consistent and efficient app deployment.     | 	Suitable for running different OS environments.


5] What is the docker life cycle ?
= Create a Dockerfile: Users define a Dockerfile containing instructions to build an image. This includes selecting a base image, installing dependencies, and defining commands.
  * [code madhech ek file cha format ahe jyachyat kay kay run karaych packges he sagl lihaych]
******
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available
EXPOSE 80

# Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
****
  Build a Docker Image: The Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image, which acts as a blueprint for the container. It is like a snapshot in a virtual machine.
  * docker build -t <image-name>:<tag> 
  * docker rmi <image-name>:<tag> // image remove 
  Run a Docker Container: The Docker image is executed to create a running container, which is the active, working instance of the application.
  * docker run -d --name <container-name> <image-name>:<tag>
  * docker start <container-name>
  * docker stop <container-name>
  * docker rm <container-name>
6] what is the docker component ?
= Docker Engine	= The core service responsible for managing containers and images.
Docker Images = 	Read-only templates that contain the application and its dependencies.
Docker Containers	= Running instances of Docker images that isolate applications.
Docker Registries =	Repositories for storing and sharing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).
Docker Volumes	= Persistent storage used to store data outside of containers, allowing data to persist.
Docker Networks	= Virtual networks used for container communication and isolation.
Docker Compose =	Tool to define and run multi-container applications with a single command using a YAML file.

7] Diff betwn Docker copy and add ?
= Docker copy which can copy only file from host system into the container & Docker add can copy the file from URL 

8] Diff betwn CMD & Entry point command ?
= Cli arguments using the docker run command will *override the argument* specified using the cmd instruction // CMD provides default arguments or a command that can be overridden at runtime.
  ENTRYPOINT sets the main command to be run when the container starts and is hard to override

9] what is diff type of Docker Networking ?
Bridge = IS a Default network [ What it is Default network : When you create a container without specifying a network, Docker automatically connects it to the bridge network.]
Host   = 
Overlay =
