Docker Networking: Definition
Docker networking allows communication between Docker containers, the host machine, and external systems.
It provides a way for containers to discover and interact with each other or with services outside of the Docker environment.
Docker networking is essential for creating isolated environments, scaling applications, and enabling services to communicate securely and efficiently.

* Types 
1] The bridge network is the default network type in Docker for standalone containers. 
It allows containers on the same Docker host to communicate with each other while isolating them from external networks.
Containers connected to a bridge network can reach each other by name or IP address.[host ani containerch ip address ha vegla aslatar tyan connect karnyasthi bridge networking vaprtat]
Example 
docker run -d --name logout nginx:latest // bridge network sathi banvlela container

2] Host Networking 
In Docker, host networking refers to the networking mode where the container shares the network namespace with the host machine.
This means the container does not have its own separate IP address, and it directly uses the host's IP address and network interfaces.
As a result, containers running with host networking can access the network exactly as the host does, without any network isolation between the host and the container.
