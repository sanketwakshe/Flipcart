IOC = Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a way to manage and set up IT infrastructure (like servers, networks, databases) using code instead of doing it manually. It allows you to write scripts or configurations to define how your systems should work, making them easy to create, update, and replicate automatically.

TERRAFORM = Terraform is an open-source tool used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It allows you to define, provision, and manage your cloud infrastructure using a simple, human-readable configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON

2] what is state file and advantageus of state file ?
= 1]  Store your state files remotely, not on your local machine!
  It's better to save the state file in a remote location (like a cloud storage bucket or Terraform Cloud).
  2] It is not a good idea to store the state file in source control
  3] Do not manipulate the state file
     Never manually edit the state file—it’s not meant to be changed by hand.


tell me about your terraform setup , are you using state file locally or git file ?
= 
In a typical Terraform setup, there are two main options for managing the Terraform state file:
1] State File Locally
  Description: The state file is stored on your local machine, usually in the same directory as your Terraform project. This is the default behavior.
2]  Remote State 
  The state file is stored in a shared location, such as 
  1] git 2] cloud 3] terraform cloud/enterprise
   Local State: Good for small projects or one-person teams.
   Remote State: Essential for team collaboration or production environments.
