IOC = Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a way to manage and set up IT infrastructure (like servers, networks, databases) using code instead of doing it manually. It allows you to write scripts or configurations to define how your systems should work, making them easy to create, update, and replicate automatically.

TERRAFORM = Terraform is an open-source tool used for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). It allows you to define, provision, and manage your cloud infrastructure using a simple, human-readable configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON
