In Git, different types of branches help organize the development workflow, making it easier to manage code changes, new features, and releases. Hereâ€™s what each branch type typically means:

Master Branch:
The primary branch in a Git repository, representing the latest stable version of the code.
It's usually kept clean and stable, containing only thoroughly tested and ready-for-production code.
Major changes or releases are typically merged into the master branch once development and testing are complete.

Feature Branch:
A branch created for working on a specific feature or improvement.
Feature branches allow developers to work on new features in isolation, without affecting the main codebase.
Once the feature is complete and tested, the feature branch is merged into the main branch (often the develop or master branch).
Naming convention is often feature/feature-name (e.g., feature/user-auth).

Release Branch:
Created when the codebase is ready for a new release.
It serves as a final preparation branch, where bug fixes, small tweaks, or minor adjustments are made to ensure the code is stable.
Once tested and finalized, the release branch is merged into both the master branch (for deployment) and another branch like develop (to keep it up-to-date).
Naming convention is often release/version-number (e.g., release/1.0.0).
